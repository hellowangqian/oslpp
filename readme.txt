This code should be able to reproduce the experimental results reported in the manuscript.
The data for Office31 and Office-Home are also uploaded as separate compressed files. If one wants to reproduce the results, please download these data files and uncompress them to the "data" folder.

1. It is simple to run the code: open Matlab, run "main_office31.m" or "main_officeHome.m" to get the results. They can be finished in less than 10 seconds for Office31 and less than 10 minutes for Office-Home denpending on the machine specs.
2. You should be able to see the results:
Office31:
Average performance over all tasks: OS=89.0, OS*=89.3, UNK=85.8, HOS=87.5
Office-Home:
Average performance over all tasks: OS=64.0, OS*=63.7, UNK=71.9, HOS=67.0
