# Overview
This code should be able to reproduce the experimental results reported in the manuscript "Progressively Select and Reject Pseudo-labelled Samples for Open-Set Domain Adaptation"

A python implementation by @tanyapole is available [here](https://github.com/tanyapole/reproduce-OSLPP)
# Access to data
You can download extracted features used in our experiments from [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/293h2sij1oirn3y/AAD_J8ZReGHglzw84RSs6sb8a?dl=0) or [BaiduPan](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1tLfPuOj8745bme4omzAcNg) code: 57ar\

# How to run
1. It is simple to run the code: open Matlab, run "main_office31.m" or "main_officeHome.m" to get the results. They can be finished in less than 10 seconds for Office31 and less than 10 minutes for Office-Home denpending on the machine specs.
2. You should be able to see the results:
Office31:
Average performance over all tasks: OS=89.0, OS*=89.3, UNK=85.8, HOS=87.5
Office-Home:
Average performance over all tasks: OS=64.0, OS*=63.7, UNK=71.9, HOS=67.0
